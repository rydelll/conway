The **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is played on a grid of cells that can be either alive or dead. Once an initial state of cells is defined the game will progress in discrete generations where each new generation determined from the current generation. The state of each cell is updated based on a set of rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer that two live neighbours dies.
2. Any live cell with two or three neighbours live on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neightbours dies.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
